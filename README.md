How To Use This Repo
-----------------------

Follow these directions closely to switch over to this repository.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your ```~/my_projects``` folder.
3. Create a directory in the ```BEWD_SF_12_homework``` folder using your real name and github account name, like ```BEWD_SF_12_homework/ChristineLau-chylaudes```. That will make it easier for us to remember who everyone's github name is. :)
4. For each homework make sure to put your files in a new `hw_x` directory in your named directory.   Example for homework #3: `BEWD_SF_12_homework/ChristineLau-chylaudes/hw_3/`

Example of what your folders should look something like:

```
~/projects/BEWD_SF_12_homework/ChristineLau-chylaude/hw_1/whatever_it_is.rb
```
